- Listener.process_push callback can return `:stop`, meaning subscription should be stopped
  and pushes that are already in mailbox should be purged.

# Changelog for extreme v1.0.0-beta2

# Changelog for Extreme v0.8.0

- Listener won't crash if ES is down. It will try to reconnect each 1sec instead of immediately
- Extreme.Listener.caught_up/0 callback is public now
- Bumped up all dependency versions

# Changelog for Extreme v0.7.1

- When connecting to ES cluster choose mode :write (default) to prefer Master over Slave or :read for opposite

# Changelog for Extreme v0.7.0

- When read_and_stay_subscribed/7 function is called, :caught_up message is sent to subscriber after existing events
  are read (or if there were no events) and before new events arrive. This is sign to your listener that you are
  up-to-date. If you don't have catch all handle_info/2 in your receiver this is breaking change!
